#? Tree
    # The Tree Data Structure is a non-linear data structure in which a collection of elements 
    # known as nodes are connected to each other via edges such that there exists exactly one 
    # path between any two nodes.
    
    #* Trees, such as Binary Search Trees (BSTs), are used in various applications, including:
        # - Databases for efficient searching
        # - File systems for organizing files
        # - Network routing algorithms
        # - The Document Object Model (DOM) in web development, which is a type of tree structure.

#? Binary Tree
    # A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, 
    # referred to as the left child and the right child.

#? Binary Search Tree (BST)
    # A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure used for organizing and storing data in a sorted manner. 
    # Each node in a BST has at most two children, a left child and a right child. 
    # The left child contains values less than the parent node, while the right child contains values greater than 
    # the parent node. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
